NOTE: This game is probably not going to be very good.

It is the year 1950. The Tusk cabinet's austerity policies have taken their toll upon the people of Echaven. As the Communist Party, your aim is to compete with both the bourgois parties and the Social-Democrats, ensuring a strong left-wing influence in the next cabinet. Good luck.
